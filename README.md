# TassuP's Godot stuff

This repository is for some little things I've made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org). There is only one demo for now, but I will add more stuff when I come up with something usefull or fun.

Everything here is released under MIT-license.

## Texture Painter
This is a small demo showing how to paint textures directly to a 3D-model. Something like Texture Paint mode in Blender.

# TassuP's Godot stuff

This repository is for some little things I've made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org). Everything here is released under MIT-license, so you can use them in any way you like. No need to give me credit.

## Delaunay Triangulator
A basic 2D Delaunay triangulation demo for Godot. This demo just creates a MeshInstance from random points, but the algorithm can be used for generating terrain heightmaps, convex hulls, navmeshes, vectorizing bitmaps, caves in a roguelike, etc.

## Texture Painter
This is a small demo showing how to paint textures directly to a 3D-model. Something like Texture Paint mode in Blender.
